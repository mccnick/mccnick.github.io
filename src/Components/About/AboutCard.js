            <br /> I'm currently a rising Senior at Iowa State University
            majoring in Software Engineering, graduating in December 2025. My
            first year at Iowa State I majored in Aerospace Engineering, and
            enjoyed the programming projects so much I made the switch to
            Software Engineering.
            <br />
            <br />
            I pride myself on leading teams and engineering projects, and have
            led every team I have been a part of during my undergraduate career.
            Each team I have been on has been successful. I always choose the
            leadership/team manager role to enable my teams to be efficient
            through highly effective communication, planning and time management
            to stay on track and meet deadlines.
            <br />
            <br />
            I am proficient with many technologies, but a few I enjoy and am
            most experienced with are: Python, Java, JavaScript/React, and C. I
            enjoy solving problems, helping people and making cool stuff ☺
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from work, school and engineering, some other activities that I love
            to do:
